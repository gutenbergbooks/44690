<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reading one day in our "Organ,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I was happy and quite at ease.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A band was playing the "<i>Lost Chord</i>,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Outside&mdash;in three several keys.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But <i>I</i> cared not how they were playing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Those puffing Teutonic men;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I'd "cut the record" at cycling,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And was ten-mile champion then!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It flooded my cheeks with crimson,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The praise of my pluck and calm;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though that band seemed blending "Kafoozleum"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With a touch of the Hundredth Psalm.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But my joy soon turned into sorrow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My calm into mental strife;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For my Record was "cut" on the morrow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And it cut <i>me</i>, like a knife.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A fellow had done the distance</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the tenth of a second less!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And henceforth my name in silence</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was dropt by the Cycling Press.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have sought&mdash;but I seek it vainly&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With that Record again to shine.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Midst crack names in our Cycling Organ,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But they never mention mine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It may be some day at the Oval</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I may cut that Record again,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But at present the Cups are given</span><br />

<p class="ph4">CONCLUSIVE.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Hibernian Table d'hôte.</i></p>

<p><i>Guest.</i> "<span class="sc">Waiter! I say&mdash;this is Pork! I want Mutton!</span>"</p>

<p><i>Waiter</i> (<i>rather bustled</i>). "<span class="sc">Yes, Sorr, it's Mutton ye
<i>want</i>,&mdash;but it's Pork ye'll <i>have!</i></span>"</p></div>




<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="sc">Of Course.</span>&mdash;Directly it was known that Sir <span class="sc">William
Harcourt</span> had accepted an invitation to contest West Monmouthshire,
and that Mr. <span class="sc">Warmington</span> had generously offered to retire
in his favour, there was a rush for the evident joke of styling
the self-effacing Q.C. "Mr. <span class="sc">Warmingpan</span>." It is uncertain
which paper was the first to get the Warmingpan into its sheets. Sir
<span class="sc">William</span> did not find the vacated seat too hot to hold him.
Just nice.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">New Titles.</span>&mdash;Sir <span class="sc">Henry Loch</span> is created Baron
<span class="sc">Loch</span> of Drylaw. The title will be appropriately written out
on parchment. For was there ever a more dry-as-dust title than that of
a Barren Loch and Dry Law!! Mr. <span class="sc">Stern</span> comes to the front as
Baron <span class="sc">Wandsworth</span>: not of Wandsworth Common, "and so," as a
Shakspearian clown might say, "the title is uncommon." Finally</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cock a doodle doo!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lord <span class="sc">Houghton's</span> Earl of Crewe!</span><br />
</p>

<p>being, evidently, the living representative of <span class="sc">Shakspeare's</span>
"Early Village Cock."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="ph4">SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ballotery.</span>&mdash;The Cork Agricultural Society had before it a
proposal of the County Board to rent their ground for holding sports.
The Chairman said,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was to be understood that the grounds would only be let on the
understanding that no drink would be sold, and that <i>no political
meetings or gambling</i> would be allowed."</p></blockquote>

<p>Rather hard on politicians this, to bracket their patriotic endeavours
with pitch-and-toss and alcoholic indulgence! If politics are like
strong drink, nobody at any rate can call them a form of "refreshment"!
But defeated candidates will quite agree that the game of "<i>bleu et
jaune</i>" is a good deal worse than "<i>rouge et noir</i>."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">A Day Shift.</span>&mdash;From the <i>North British Daily Mail</i> comes news
of a daring electoral outrage. The Liberal candidate wanted to address
the colliers in one of the Lanarkshire towns; but his meeting was very
poorly attended. The cause was that the colliers were all waiting at
the bottom of the pit ready to be drawn up, but "it was found necessary
to send down an extra quantity of wood at that particular time"; so
that the colliers could not get to the surface for an hour, when the
political meeting was over! Smart man, the Conservative agent in that
division! The pitmen could not be wound up, so the meeting was. It
isn't only in Lanark that the Liberal Party wants a lift!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">"Litteral" Truth.</span>&mdash;The effects of the General Election on the
Press seem to be most marked in Ireland. An Irish contemporary has the
following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="sc">Ireland. The Viceroyalty to be abolilhed.</span>&mdash;Colonel
<span class="sc">Saunderson</span>, addressing the Orangemen of Diamond, near Armagh,
said that Lord <span class="sc">Lalisbury's</span> Government would bring in a Bil to
obolieh the office of Irish Viceroy."</p></blockquote>

<p>What is really to happen to the Irish Viceroy is rather mysterious.
Is he to be "abolilhed," or only "oboliehed"? Perhaps "Lord
<span class="sc">Lalisbury</span>" will kindly explain.</p>

<p class="ph4">DRINKING SCENE OF THE FUTURE.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>In consequence of the Growing Demand for Lighter Liquors.</i>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The interior of a Dining-room. The ladies have just
left, and the gentlemen are discussing their beverages.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Smith.</i> I say, <span class="sc">Brown</span>, if it is not an impertinent question,
where <i>did</i> you get that toast-and-water?</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> I thought you would be deceived! It was a cup, not the pure
article! My butler is a first-rate hand at it. I will give you the
recipe if you like.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Do. It was excellent. What <i>is</i> the secret?</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Something, I fancy, to do with watercress.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> I say, <span class="sc">Brown</span>, that was really very nice sherbet.
Turkish or Persian?</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Neither. Came from the Stores. Home-made.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Well, it certainly was capital. I could have sworn that it had
been manufactured East of the Levant.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> More likely East of Temple Bar. And now shall we have a
whitewash before we join the ladies?</p>

<p><i>Six Guests.</i> No, thanks! Really not!</p>

<p><i>Half-a-dozen more of the Company.</i> Really not! No, thanks!</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Nonsense! (<i>Produces a pint bottle of lemonade.</i>) Nonsense,
I repeat! Look here, my boys. (<i>Locks door.</i>) Not one of you fellows
shall leave the room until you have finished <i>this!</i></p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dear <span class="sc">Charlie</span>,&mdash;O 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray, an' three more, and a tiger! Great Scott!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm as 'appy as ten on 'em, <span class="sc">Charlie</span>, though thusty and thundering 'ot.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've bin up to my eyes in it this time, and now these 'ere Polling Returns</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are a-sending me slap off my chump, though I'm sorry they didn't chuck <span class="sc">Burns</span>.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! I'm feeling O K and a arf; I could stand on my 'ed with delight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the Rads are knocked out in three rounds, 'Ome Rule's smashed, and Old England's all right.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And although it is late, and I'm tired, I'm so full of our Glorious Win,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I feel I <i>must</i> sit down and drop yer a line, mate, afore I turn in.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm the Pet of the Primrosers, <span class="sc">Charlie</span>, and, 'ang it, I've earned it all round,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I've worked like a nig, and no error. It suits me right down to the ground.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've canvassed and posted tremenjous, I'm 'usky with cheer and chi-ike,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I've mounted the Unionist colours, and blazed round the streets on a bike.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There was full arf a mile on us, <span class="sc">Charlie</span>, a scarlet percession on wheels;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With Japanese lanterns a-flying, and 'underds o' kids at our 'eels.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I felt I was "charging the guns," like that brave Ballyclava Brigade,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With shouts for "Lord <span class="sc">Mungo</span> and Malt!" and a little one in for "The Trade."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I tell yer, old man, 'twos hexciting. We dashed along Mulberry Scrubs.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And up the 'igh street a rare buster, 'ocrayed by the bhoys at the Pubs.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We scooted around for ten mile, the 'ole distance one thunderin' cheer;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <i>when</i> we pulled up at the "Crown," if you'd just seen me lower the beer!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I lapped off a quart in one quencher. "<i>That</i>'s rippin'!" sez I to the Bung.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I felt liked a dashed wooden 'orse, with a lump o' red leather for tongue."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ah!" sez 'e, "and jest fancy, old man, if them Vetoers 'ad their vile way,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wy, <i>I</i> couldn't sell you a tankard, and <i>you</i> wouldn't 'ave any say!"</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But jimminy-whizz, <i>'ow</i> we squelched 'em! We got our man in two to one,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though our neighbourhood used to vote Rad, and a Tory was not in the run.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wot beans it must be to old <span class="sc">'Arcourt</span>, wot toko to <span class="sc">Lawson</span> and <span class="sc">Caine</span>!</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let big pots make the round o' the pubs, and they won't talk that footy fal-lal.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Labour wants steddy work and good wyges, and likes to see England look big;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then, with its baccy and beer, it's all one to it, Tory <i>or</i> Whig.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wot's it care for Welsh Churches, or Scotch 'uns, as don't 'ardly enter its own?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as to 'Ome Rule&mdash;for yer worker there's dashed little meat on <i>that</i> bone.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Talk of Betterment, Progress, Peer-smashing, and such-like, may do for the Clubs;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But all Labour <i>gits</i> is 'igh rates, shocking trade, and a raid on its pubs.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Workman sez it's too good enough, <span class="sc">Charlie</span>; believes as it's better by far</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To vote for Old <span class="sc">Sol</span>, a big Navy, an' maybe a olly good war.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's sick of the bloomin' old forriners copping our trade and our tin,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And 'e's game for Protection <i>and</i> Peers&mdash;<i>anythink</i>, so Old England may win!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If the Rads wont his vote for the future, they've got somethink <i>solid</i> to do!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Village Councils and Vetoes won't work it, for all <span class="sc">Billy 'Arcourt's</span> boohoo!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'E don't wont less beer, but more beer-money, ah! and 'e don't care a blow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If 'e gits it from <span class="sc">Rosebery</span> and <span class="sc">'Arcourt</span>, or <span class="sc">Solsbury</span>, <span class="sc">Balfour</span> and <span class="sc">Joe</span>!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But 'ang it, I'm preaching, old oyster, and giving them Rads the straight tip.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One thing, they won't take it, this lot won't; they ain't got no savvy, no grip.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bin sloppin' all over the place like, a-fillin' their cup, and that rot,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now, arter tackling the pewter, they find as they've all gone to pot.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O ain't it ske-rumptious, my pippin? I feel I could washup Brum <span class="sc">Joe</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I'm bound to admit, next to Bung, us true Tories must thank <i>him</i> this go.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's crumped 'is old pals a fair knock-out. If <span class="sc">Solsbury's</span> saddle 'e'll carry,</span><br />

Ah, here's the first&mdash;"Hereford. Unionist Majority, 313. No change."
You can't <i>expeck</i> none in a rotten place like that! You <i>wait</i> a

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A London Dinner Party.</i></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Lambert</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="sc">Crumpington</span> (<i>chance
partners</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mr. Lambert</i> (<i>feeling his way</i>). Been to the Opera often this season,
Mrs. <span class="sc">Crumpington</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Crumpington.</i> Oh, very often. I am so devoted to music, you know,
that I go whenever I can. And, talking of music, have you heard that
new pianist, Herr&mdash;what <i>is</i> his name?&mdash;oh yes, Herr <span class="sc">Widowski</span>?
He's too delicious for words!</p>

<p><i>Mr. L.</i> No; I can't say that I go to concerts much. You should talk to
my daughter <span class="sc">Ethel</span>&mdash;she's devoted to music, and they tell me
that she's got a really fine voice. I'm sure she practises enough.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Indeed? Well, I've no voice, I'm sorry to say; but I play the
piano a little&mdash;only a <i>very</i> little, you know.</p>

<p><i>Mr. L.</i> Wonderful what a lot of people <i>do</i> play in these
days&mdash;(<i>hastily</i>)&mdash;not like <i>you</i>, of course; but one hears pianos and
fiddles going in every house, and most of them are simply instruments
of torture.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Rather a rash remark&mdash;isn't it? You've never
heard me play, you see! (Mr. L. <i>endeavours to protest</i>.) Oh, but
I assure you I quite agree with you. For instance, my next-door
neighbours are always making the most awful noises&mdash;playing and singing
morning, noon, and night. The wall is very thin, and I am nearly driven
crazy.</p>

<p><i>Mr. L.</i> (<i>warmly</i>). My dear Madam, I can sympathise with you entirely.
I've often thought that Parliament ought to pass a Bill for enforcing
a close-time in domestic music. Of course it only matters to me in the
evening, but we're troubled exactly in the same way as yourself. And
my poor <span class="sc">Ethel</span> finds her singing constantly interrupted by the
disgusting row made by our next-door neighbour. I suppose he must take
a pleasure in annoying us&mdash;anyhow he's jammed his wretched piano right
up against our drawing-room wall, and bangs and thumps on it for about
six hours a day. Of course it would be bad enough if the fellow played
well; but you never heard such ghastly noises as he makes!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> How sorry I am for your poor daughter! Yes; people complain
in the papers and grumble about street-bands and piano-organs; but at
least one can send them away&mdash;which, unfortunately, one can't do in the
case of next-door neighbours! However, I suppose I ought to be grateful
that the people on the other side don't play at all.</p>

<p><i>Mr. L.</i> Ah! I live in a corner-house. But I think a little opposition
noise would almost be a relief&mdash;a kind of homeopathic cure, you know.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> One's quite enough for <i>me</i>. It's been getting worse, too,
these last few weeks, and I'm delighted to meet a fellow-sufferer.
Come; can't we concoct some joint scheme of deliverance? Do
you think it would answer if I sent round a polite note&mdash;"Mrs.
<span class="sc">Crumpington</span> presents her compliments to Mr."&mdash;whatever their
name is&mdash;"and would be extremely obliged,"&mdash;and so on. How would that
do?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L.</i> (<i>decisively</i>). Wouldn't be the least use, I assure you, or
I'd have tried that plan myself long ago. The only result would be that
they'd make more row than ever, on purpose to score off you. No, I
fancy I've got a better plan than that.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). Oh, do tell me what it is!</p>

<p><i>Mr. L.</i> Well, I happened to notice in a shop in Holborn the other day
one of these new American toys, it's a kind of small fog-horn, driven
by a pair of bellows. And the noise it makes is something terrific, I
assure you&mdash;loud enough to drown half-a-dozen pianos. So I've ordered
one of these, and as soon as ever that scoundrel strikes up next door,
I shall turn on the horn; then, directly he stops, I'll stop too, you
see. Rather a good idea, don't you think?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> (<i>much amused</i>). It is, <i>indeed!</i> If only the poor wretch
next door knew what was in store for him! Oh, if only I could silence
<i>my</i> enemy in that way! But then, of course, I can't a blow a horn.</p>

<p><i>Mr. L.</i> That isn't necessary; all you have to do is to work the
bellows, and the thing goes by itself. Really, I strongly recommend you
to invest in one.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> It would be a good plan, wouldn't it? Where did you say they
are to be had?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L.</i> I'll write down the address, if I can find a scrap of paper.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="stage">[<i>Takes out a card-case from his pocket, pencils address on back of
visiting card, and hands it to</i> Mrs. C.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Thank you <i>so</i> much, I'll certainly think about getting one
(<i>looks absently at the other side of the card</i>) if they're not too
dear, and&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Gasping.</i>) Good gracious heavens!</p>

<p><i>Mr. L.</i> (<i>anxiously</i>). What's the matter? Are you ill?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> (<i>pointing to the printed side of the card in her hand</i>). Is
this your real address?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L.</i> (<i>much astonished</i>). "No. 1, Yarborough Gardens?" Yes,
certainly it is. Why do you ask?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> (<i>faintly</i>). Because&mdash;because <i>I</i> live next door at No. 3!!</p>

<p class="center">THE CARETAKER.</p>

<p>Is it time to leave town? Yes, it is time to leave town, because the
good neighbours have put up their shutters (<i>i.e.</i>, the shutters of the
good neighbours). Do all the good neighbours put up their shutters?
Yes, all put up their shutters, but one of them stays in town at
the back of the house. Why does one of the good neighbours stay in
town at the back of the house? To escape the expense of leaving town
incurred by the other good neighbours who have put up their shutters.
Is that expense a great one? Yes, a very great one. Have they any
other drawbacks? Yes, they have the annoyances of a caretaker. What
are the annoyances of a caretaker? The annoyances of a caretaker are
her husband, her children, her cat, her dog, her mother, and all
her relations. When a caretaker enters the house of one of the good
neighbours, is she accompanied by her annoyances? Yes, the caretaker is
accompanied by her annoyances. Does the caretaker lead a happy life in
the house of one of the good neighbours? Yes, she leads a happy life,
and so do her husband, her children, her cat, her dog, her mother, and
all her relations. What do the relations of the caretaker do in the
house of one of the good neighbours? They smoke in the drawing-room in
the house of one of the good neighbours. If anyone calls to see the
good neighbour, what does the caretaker do? The caretaker generally
refuses to attend to the bell. Should the caretaker attend to the
bell, what does she do? She tells the caller who wishes to see the
good neighbour that she knows nothing of the master of the house's
movements (<i>i.e.</i>, the movements of the master of the house). Does the
caller then retire under the impression that the house has been sold
up, and that the good neighbour has entered the Court of Bankruptcy
(<i>i.e.</i>, the Bankruptcy Court)? The caller does leave the house under
that impression. While this impression is being created in London,
is the good neighbour unconsciously attempting to enjoy himself in
Switzerland? Yes, the good neighbour is undoubtedly attempting to
enjoy himself in Switzerland, in spite of the cookery, the lack of
accommodation, the expense, and the weather. If the good neighbour
ceased to be unconscious, and became aware of the damage that was being
done to his credit by the caretaker, what would that good neighbour do?
The good neighbour would probably swear. Then would the good language
of the good neighbour change in its character? Yes; for it would
become the bad language of the bad neighbour. Would the bad language
of the bad neighbour have any immediate effect upon the caretaker,
her husband, her children, her cat, her dog, her mother, and all her
relatives? No, for the bad language would be uttered in Switzerland,
and the caretaker, her husband, her children, her cat, her dog, her
mother, and all her relatives would be in London. Then what would the
caretaker, her husband, her children, her cat, her dog, her mother, and
all her relatives do in the house of one of the good neighbours during
the protracted absence of the good neighbour on the Continent? They
would continue to smoke in the drawing-room.</p>

successes in the boroughs daily reached London, the leading Liberal

"If this is the best," said Sir <span class="sc">William Harcourt</span>, observing

<p><i>The Variety Stage</i>, by <span class="sc">Charles Douglas Stuart</span> and <span class="sc">A. J.
Park (Fisher Unwin)</span>, is a history of the Music-halls from the
earliest period to the present time. And a very interesting history it
is, admirably told withal. One comes upon names familiar in boyhood,
and is a little shocked to find that the Great <span class="sc">Vance</span> was
really named <span class="sc">Alfred Peck Stevens</span>. The pages glow with pleasant
peeps of London at midnight, as <i>Pendennis</i> saw it, and as, once at
least, it was looked upon by <i>Colonel Newcome</i>. It is sad to find how
many of the old favourites of the music-hall fall upon evil times, and
even die in the workhouse. <span class="sc">Sam Collins</span> was more fortunate. He
was sumptuously buried in Kensal Green, where a marble pedestal carries
his portrait and his epitaph. This last is notable as containing what,
as far as my Baronite knows, is the most audacious rhyme in the English
language. As it was admitted to consecrated ground, it may perhaps be
quoted here. "A loving husband," so it runs&mdash;</p>

<p class="author"><i>Othello</i>, Act ii., Sc. i.</p>

<p>Friday, July 19, 1895, memorable in annals of British stage as a day
set apart for one of the greatest triumphs of the Drama. Sir <span class="sc">Henry
Irving</span>, fresh from the honours of Royal Windsor, received a
further distinction at the hands and hearts of his "brothers and
sisters" in that profession for which he has done so much. Squire
<span class="sc">Bancroft</span> was the eloquent spokesman for the enthusiastic
audience of comedians and tragedians which filled the Lyceum; yet
before and behind the footlights there was not a suggestion of
histrionics. Unlike, too, the great unpaying, who have the dulness of
their <i>order</i>, the guests of Friday were remarkable for the tremendous
energy of their goodwill. If this theatre had not long been seasoned
to the sounds of vociferous cheering, the demonstration might "have
brought down the house" literally. <i>Mr. Punch</i> takes this opportunity
of joining in the demonstration, and drinks to Sir <span class="sc">Henry
Irving</span>. May the Knight of the cheerful countenance prosper
according to his deserts. And, if that wish is realised, the lessee of
the Lyceum will be one of the happiest men on record.</p>

referring to the success of Mr. <span class="sc">G. H. Allsopp</span> at Worcester,
just prior to that eminent Unionist taking unto himself a wife,
suggests that the newly-elected M.P. should follow the precedent set
by Mr. <span class="sc">Griffith-Boscawen</span> in 1892, and give to each of his
bridesmaids a brooch with the amount of his majority engraved upon it.
This is all very well in its way. But the total at Tunbridge was 933,
while that of Worcester extended to four figures. So to give room for
labelling, the brooch should be changed to a bracelet. A man bearing

front." But it is a question addressed to many outside the theatre and
the theatrical profession; to all sorts and conditions of men and women
who still regard the stage askance, and who look upon the ultimate
fate of theatre-goers and actors as a melancholy certainty. To these
persons, whether a minority or a majority,&mdash;in either case a "narrow"
one,&mdash;Sir <span class="sc">Henry's</span> kindly invitation is publicly addressed, and
it is "Won't you come round?"</p>

<p class="ph3">ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</p>

<p>To the philosophical mind of a Roundabout Reader the General Election
ought to offer many points of interest, not because he is a politician,
but because, in the interest of his reading, he has to occupy a
position of detachment, and therefore perhaps sees more of the humours
and absurdities which crowd the animated scene. Yet here, for instance,
am I, a diligent turner over of every possible kind of newspaper,
metropolitan and provincial, and all that I have carried away from my
careful investigations is a confused sense that if electors on either
side only "stand shoulder to shoulder," "leave no stone unturned,"
and "work as one man from now till the polling-day," why each tide is
positively certain that "another nail will be driven into the coffin"
of the other side, that "a resounding blow will be struck for the
good cause," and that "the banner under which we have secured many a
brilliant victory will once more float triumphantly in the breeze." As
for the "moral victories" gained, they are almost overwhelming both in
number and in result.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Indeed, there is nothing so dangerously attractive to speaker and to
audience as a fine old crusted political tag. Policies and programmes
are as dust in the balance. As you listen to a speaker and watch his
hearers, you may see a smile of perfect confidence and satisfaction
spreading over the faces of the latter while the former winds himself
up to the well-known, fondly-loved, and long-expected tag, which is the
inevitable conclusion of the fiery oratorical period. "That," they say
to themselves, "is the man for us. He says exactly what we should have
said in the only appropriate words." Result&mdash;<i>Loud and enthusiastic
cheers, amidst which</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Plattit-Ewd</span> <i>resumed his seat,

sparkling gibes, have they not been trotted out from Land's End to

blind as Liberal (or Conservative) kittens, and converted, through the
opening of your eyes, into Conservative (or Liberal) kittens; welcome
also, ye hounds, who have devoured all your labels, and know not your
destination. Many a time have I hunted with your sporting pack, and
seen my friends ride gallantly at your tails. Also there is a wolf, and
there is a lamb; and there was once a Sibyl who dealt in books, and
there is an Italian who, having performed the most coruscating solos on
the barrel-organ, failed miserably when asked to oblige upon the piano.
All these have played their parts nobly. Not for long do I bid them
farewell. They will return, I know they will, with the first mutterings
of the next election.</p>

<p>As an example of how political conflicts ought to be carried on take
the case of West Fife. While Mr. <span class="sc">Augustine Birrell</span>, the
Radical Candidate, was speaking in Thornton School, "the door of
the room was opened, and Mr. <span class="sc">Wemyss</span>, the Liberal Unionist
candidate for the constituency, asked 'May I come in,' to which Mr.
<span class="sc">Birrell</span> replied 'Yes, certainly.' Mr. <span class="sc">Wemyss</span>, who
was followed by a large number of supporters, then entered the hall,
and took a seat on one of the front benches, which he occupied until
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> close of the address, when he was greeted with loud calls for
a speech. In response to the call, he remarked that he had already
made eight or nine speeches that day, and must be excused from making
another. He had, however, enjoyed Mr. <span class="sc">Birrell's</span> speech very
much. It was not for him to criticise it at that meeting, but he might
only say that he felt sure the electors of West Fife would vote for
whom they considered the best man and the man they believed would do
his duty. He then called for three hearty cheers for his opponent,
Mr. <span class="sc">Birrell</span>. Votes of confidence were then put for both
candidates, when that in favour of Mr. <span class="sc">Birrell</span> was declared
carried. The opposing candidates then shook hands, and departed
evidently the best of friends."</p>

<p>A totally different picture comes to us from Aston Manor, as I judge
from the following letter in the <span class="sc">Birmingham Daily Gazette</span>.</p>

<p class="center">WHAT HAS BECOME OF IKE WARD?</p>

<p class="center"><i>To the Editor of the Daily Gazette.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;My attention has been drawn to an attack made by
Captain <span class="sc">Grice-Hutchinson</span> on a very respectable member of the
National Society of Amalgamated Brassworkers, Mr. <span class="sc">Ike Ward</span>.
In your yesterday's issue Captain <span class="sc">Grice-Hutchinson</span> is
reported to have said: "The last authentic account he had of Mr.
<span class="sc">Ike Ward</span> was that he was 'bones' in some nigger troupe on
the sands of Scarborough." Mr. <span class="sc">Ward</span> has been for some time
engaged as an organiser, and is a member of the Executive of the
Railway Workers' Union, has never been in a nigger troupe on the sands
of Scarborough or anywhere else.</p>

<p>As the statement is calculated to damage the reputation of my friend
Mr. <span class="sc">Ward</span>, I am sure that the candidate for Aston will at
once either give his authority for the damaging statement or withdraw
the aspersions on the character of a respected labour leader.&mdash;Yours
faithfully,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">W. J. Davis</span>.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>70, Lionel Street, Birmingham, July 13.</i></span></p></blockquote>

<hr class="short" />

<p>But after all, even if Mr. <span class="sc">Ike Ward</span> had chosen to employ
his leisure in performing on the bones in a nigger troupe on the
sands at Scarborough or elsewhere he would have done nothing to be
ashamed of. Obviously, however, Captain <span class="sc">Grice-Hutchinson's</span>
account was anything but authentic, and he had no business to cork Mr.
<span class="sc">Ward's</span> face in so gratuitous a manner.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis a manifest error, this tale about bones&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(You may like what I say, or, if not, you may lump it).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a worker in brass must produce the best tones</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If&mdash;I don't say he did it&mdash;he blew his own trumpet.</span><br />
</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In any record of electoral humour Mr. <span class="sc">Muntz</span>, the member for
Tamworth, must hold a distinguished place. Here is a report of some of
the remarks made by him at meetings in the Nuneaton Division:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Muntz</span>, in the course of his remarks, characterised Lord
<span class="sc">Salisbury's</span> Government as the most able Administration
that had ever held office in any Parliament the world over. It was
composed of all the great intellect which, prior to the introduction
of the Home Rule Bill, was divided between the two great parties
of the State. Now all that was left to the Liberal party was the
tagrag and bobtail. The late Radical Administration was a failure
under Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>, great man as he was, and a still
greater failure under Lord <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>, to whom Her Majesty
had presented the Thistle. (<i>Laughter.</i>) As to agriculture, he said
that he had a conversation with Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> on the
subject just before the dissolution. Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> said
to him, "<span class="sc">Muntz</span>, what are we to do for agriculture?" and
he replied, "That's a big question. You have all the great talent
and all the great landed interest in the country represented in the
present Government; and if the present Government can do nothing
for agriculture, there is nothing to be done for agriculture."
(<i>Applause.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>After reading this I feel that the question of agricultural distress
is settled. Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> must, indeed, be a proud man at
having obtained so much valuable information in answer to a question
which, as reported, sounds familiar almost to the verge of rashness.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Can pigs be kept at a profit? This was the question which confronted
the Devonport Guardians only the other day. The following extract from
their proceedings will be read with breathless interest:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">H. W. Bryant</span> moved "That the Guardians give up pig
keeping, either at the house or otherwise."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Healy</span> seconded.&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Oliver</span> supported, and said
they could buy the pork cheaper than keep pigs, and that every pig
they had kept cost them 1<i>s.</i> per lb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">J. Goodman</span> said he was a "piggery man." (<i>Laughter.</i>) He
liked the pig, he liked the pork, and he liked the profit that the pig
brought. He was surprised to hear Mr. <span class="sc">Oliver</span> say that the
pigs cost 1<i>s.</i> per lb. He said it did not cost them 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Chew</span> pointed out that the profit on pig keeping last year
in the house was £39.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Penberthy</span> said the master entered in his books that it
cost them 6<i>d.</i> per lb., and Mr. J. <span class="sc">Moore</span> maintained that
they could buy pork at 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> per lb. The motion was lost, 8 voting
for, and 18 against.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I'm a piggery man," said <span class="sc">Goodman, J.</span>, "though pigs are a wee bit squealy;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I won't sit still to hear pigs denounced by <span class="sc">Bryant</span> and scorned by <span class="sc">Healy</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let those who prefer it till the fields, and see what a year's hard dig brings;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>I</i> like the pig, and I like the pork, and I like the profit the pig brings."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then <span class="sc">Chew</span>, he chawed Mr. <span class="sc">Bryant</span> up, Mr. <span class="sc">Healy</span> to dust he ground, Sir;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <span class="sc">Moore</span> maintained you could purchase pork at fourpence halfpenny a pound, Sir.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the piggery men prevailed by ten, a majority quite on the big side,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since eighteen voted for pigs that day, and eight on the anti-pig side.</span><br />

<p class="ph4">BROWN AND ME.</p>

<p>Me and <span class="sc">Brown</span> has bin a having a lot of differences of opinion
all about the County Counsellers, which sumhows we carnt get to agree
together about em, not by no manner of means. And now, quite lately, we
has been a having a lot of quarrells about the members of Parlement in
the Citty, and all round about it, and, fortunetly, me and my frends
has wun nearly ewery place where there has bin any think like a jolly
good fight, and has now wun nearly the hole blooming lot on em! So that
the poor County Counsellors has hardly got a single member of Parlement
left among the whole blooming lot, and is obliged to have long rambling
speeches among theirselves jest to fill up their idle time. How they
can manage to keep things agoing jest while they makes their old long
speeches, I carnt for the life of me make out; but I am told that they
all agrees that its the only means they has of keeping up their old
Charter; and altho it isnt werry much to brag about, they all agrees
its sumthink better than nothink.</p>

</div>

<p>Lots of the poor chaps who has been acustomed to go about different
parts of London a braggin about the werry great figgers they cuts, or
was used to cut, afore the new changes as took place in making amost
everybody members of Parlement, is now obleeged to do their werry best
to keep things a going cumfertably, if possibel; but its but poor work
for em, and but a werry poor change for things as was afore they was as
they is.</p>

<p>Why, I'm litterelly told as how there is now lots of Gents as was
once Members of Parlement who aint now members for nothink! that it
to say, not for nothink as is worth having. Why, I'm ewen told as the
County Counsellers, as belongs to the Tems Conserwency, is now so ardly
treated, that they werry offen carnt get enuff to do to keep their time
well employed, or to get enuff monney to pay them their werry modderate
wages; so eny boddy can werry easily emadgin what poor work it must now
be for poor fellers as was once Members of Parlement, and now aint not
members of not nothink!</p>

<p>Sum of the old members tells me as they doesnot despair ewen yet! for
they are quite sure as how as numbers of the grand old Tories will
stick to em as long as theres any left; but I thinks as I knows a trick
worth too of that, and that is, to make the best of the things as is,
and hope the best for all the changes as time and hoppertoonity will
aford em of putting a few things together as their long xperience has
tort em is easily turned to good account.</p>
